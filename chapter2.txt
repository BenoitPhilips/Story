Chapter2 :

Exercise for using Git and see the differences

In the teststory, we inserted, replaced (the word differences) and deleted (the word Exercise).

So we will replace the word differences to create a conflict :
- differences becomes mechanism
- Exercise is replaced by workshop
- Git is modified by Github
