Chapter2 :

1. Original text on master :
Exercise for using Git and see the differences

In the teststory, we inserted, replaced (the word differences) and deleted (the word Exercise).

So we will replace the word differences to create a conflict :
- differences becomes mechanism
- Exercise is replaced by workshop
- Git is modified by Github

2. Changed text on teststory
for using Git and see the functioning

In this chapter 2, we added some text while being on branch teststory.
We also deleted the word "Exercise" in from of textline 2.
and finally we replace the word differences by functioning also on text line 2

3. Result after use the mergetool (FileMerge)
Workshop for using Git and see the functioning
